[["index.html", "DfE Dashboard Standards for Power BI reports and dashboards Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Purpose", " DfE Dashboard Standards for Power BI reports and dashboards Department for Education guidance 2021-09-09 Chapter 1 Introduction Power BI is Microsoft software that allows the user to create interactive dashboards/ reports/apps. It is designed to enable users to create self-service Business Intelligence (BI) tools, enabling their customers to make timely informed decisions based on their data. DfE analysts have been able to download and use Power BI since January 2018. From this date, analysts have been able to create internal tools and share them with colleagues within the department. From March 2019, analysts in ESFA Data Science Division have also been able to release dashboards to educational providers via a web portal called View Your Education Data (VYED). Below is a link to the gov.uk standards https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style 1.1 Purpose This document provides a high-level guide to aid in the design of consistent and high-quality Power BI dashboards. The overall aim of these guidelines is to help the analyst create logical, well-designed dashboards that are built correctly first time and easy for readers to understand and navigate, without any background reading. These guidelines are intended as a starting point for modellers when considering how to design dashboards, but it is for the modeller to determine how this is to be achieved. It is also hoped that this guide will start the conversation between modellers/teams to help improve standards. They are not designed to be a colour by numbers guide to dashboards, as each dashboard will have its own unique set of requirements and the modellers will have their own preferences and style. This document works alongside the Departments Style Guide: DfE style guide (sharepoint.com) "],["planning.html", "Chapter 2 Planning 2.1 The requirements 2.2 Select the right type of dashboard 2.3 Input data", " Chapter 2 Planning 2.1 The requirements Identify the business need. Every report tells a story Make sure that story matches the business need Dont include visuals that dont match the business need. If you believe there is a visual that will provide substantial insight  discuss this with users/the customer to see if this provides useful insight and is relevant to their needs Identify the customer. Design a report that uses familiar terminology and complexity on a par with the customers level of knowledge Design separate report pages for different customer types  this may extend to creating separate reports for separate users, will all reports connected to the same dataset Choose appropriate visuals Visualisations give insight into the data in the most effective way possible Visuals such as charts and graphs make it easier to interpret the data A report can have one or more pages of visuals and is based on one dataset A dashboard is a single page containing the most important visuals, to give an at-a-glance view of the whole report Identify the data Filter the amount shown in the visual with minimal impact to the end user Remove tables or columns that are unused Avoid distinct counts on fields with high cardinality (i.e., millions of values) Avoid unnecessary precision - split date-time values into separate columns Use integers instead of strings, where possible Be wary of DAX functions that need to test every row in a table (e.g. RANKX is perhaps the worst culprit for this) 2.2 Select the right type of dashboard There are three common types of dashboard, each performing a specific purpose. The types of dashboard are: operational dashboards strategic/executive dashboards analytical dashboards Operational dashboards Operational dashboards often require real-time or near real-time data. They monitor the performance of your operation and can be useful for checking performance or network traffic, usage etc. An example of an operational dashboard, taken from https://ubiq.co/analytics-blog. The dashboard is updated regularly to display data from the last seven days, for example sign ups and site visitors. Strategic/executive dashboards Strategic dashboards will typically provide the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that a companys executive team track on a periodic (daily, weekly or monthly) basis, and should provide the executive team with a high-level overview of the state of the business together with the opportunities the business faces. An example of a strategic dashboard, taken from https://www.scoro.com. The dashboard displays KPIs and provides an overview of performance within the business. Analytical dashboards This type of dashboard will offer drill-down functionality - allowing the user to explore more of the data and get different insights. Often dashboards include this functionality when it is not required. An example of an analytical dashboard, taken from blog.oribi.io. The dashboard allows the user to filter data and focus on areas that are important to them. 2.3 Input data Rather than importing the entire data set in Power BI, we should identify the typical information that our viewer wants to see and based on that, we can create database queries to retrieve only that part of data. Input data in the report should be exactly as supplied by the supplier. Modellers should not be making manual adjustments to supplied data and any amendments should be done by auditable formulas within the model, not prior to the data going into the model. Gauge an understanding of the data, as this will affect how you want to visualise it: how was it collected - manual or automatic data quality - is it accurate, concise and complete type of data - funding, performance reviews etc level of data - simplified overview or specific detail amount of data - is it all required hierarchy - ability to drill down or not Liaise carefully with those supplying the input to ensure a full appreciation of scope, definitions and quality, etc. As a minimum, record: who supplied it and when a link (if available, e.g. if it is published data) its level of quality assurance if/when it requires updating If Official Statistics are being used/created liaise with the statistics team to ensure they are used correctly Ensure that the dashboard data is refreshed at appropriate intervals. This will save time during development and should ensure optimal performance once the dashboard is live. It is also worth considering whether importing your data or Direct Query is more appropriate. It may be that you import the data while you are developing the dashboard, and then work with a data modeller to add the extra data manipulation that you require to the underlying data cube once the dashboard design is finalised. This will then allow you to switch to Direct Query once the dashboard is running as a Business As Usual process. "],["data-processing-and-modelling.html", "Chapter 3 Data processing and modelling 3.1 Data processing 3.2 Data modelling", " Chapter 3 Data processing and modelling 3.1 Data processing With Power BI Desktop you can connect to many different types of data in many formats. We cannot ensure that the data being collected is accurate and error-free, although the modeller should have an understanding of the data quality as described in Section 2.3 above, and may need to communicate the implications of the data quality on the information in the dashboard to the customer. Data caveats including any filtering or replacement should go on the cover sheet. We need to understand the mentality of our viewers/audience, such as: How they want to organize the report and how they want to see the report? What are the main/major areas that people are interested to see in report? 3.2 Data modelling Data Modelling is shaping the data to meet your needs, to enable you to create visual reports that you can share with others. Shaping data means transforming the data  such as renaming columns or tables, changing text to numbers, removing rows, setting the first row as headers etc. Combining data means connecting to two or more data sources, shaping them as needed, then consolidating them into one useful query. Optimize the data-model by doing the following: Shape and combine data Group rows Pivot columns Use date tables where necessary Create custom columns (e.g. calculated columns, measures &amp; tables) If its possible in the model, consider creating a measure only table Set data types correctly Use of query formulas Use user-friendly formatting to the data Use user-friendly naming conventions for fields, measures and tables Validate relationships between tables are created correctly Use the right visualization that communicates the story of the data as clearly as possible. Remember the user and their experience with your solution! Extensive data modelling should not be performed in Power BI, as this will be slow and not provide a good user experience. If the data requires substantial manipulation, best practice would be to do the data modelling in a format such as SQL or Tabular first. The data model can then be imported to Power BI to build the dashboard. The balance between how much to do in Power BI vs other formats will vary from project to project, and the modeler must use their judgement to decide what is appropriate. "],["governance-and-quality-assurance.html", "Chapter 4 Governance and Quality Assurance 4.1 Governance 4.2 Quality assurance", " Chapter 4 Governance and Quality Assurance 4.1 Governance Each report should include a department/agency logo in the top left corner. All dashboards should have a version control page and information about who to contact for feedback/issues. It should also include an introduction to the dashboard and individual reports should have a short paragraph explaining the purpose of the report. Use the version control standards (to be determined) for each major change. Use a naming convention that allows files to be sorted in chronological order and always include the version number in the filename. v.0.1 for 1st draft copy, then 0.1 increments for reviewed amendments v1.0 for the signed-off copy (and 0.1 increments for minor change requests) 4.2 Quality assurance The DfE Quality Assurance Framework applies to all analysis, including dashboards. A bespoke Dashboard QA log can be found on the QA Sharepoint pages. The QA log is based on the DfE QA framework but has been tailored such that the checks suggested, and language used, are more specific to dashboards. The log should be used for any dashboards that have required a total of 3 or more days resource to create or which have a high impact. By using the log, you can record QA activity through ratings, comments, and recommendations for further action. The QA ratings given for each area will be converted into an overall QA score for your dashboard which can be seen at the top of the page. As per the wider guidance around using a QA log, you are free to add additional activities to the log to record any other checks that have taken place. It is also important to remember that the purpose of the log is to reflect the level of risk associated with the work therefore where proportionate QA has been carried out the QA log score may be low and/or there may be several areas that show as red or amber. As long as your customers are aware of and happy to accept the level of risk, that is totally acceptable. If that is not the case, further QA activities may be required in order to strengthen the QA and reduce risk. If you have any questions about the QA framework or the dashboard QA log, or if you have any suggestions about how the dashboard QA log could be improved, please contact Model Improvement and Assurance Unit using the following email: modellingandqa@educationgovuk.onmicrosoft.com "],["visualisations.html", "Chapter 5 Visualisations 5.1 Things to avoid 5.2 Simple, concise and easy to understand 5.3 Titles and labelling 5.4 Numbers 5.5 Rounding 5.6 Ordering categories 5.7 Filters 5.8 Interactions 5.9 Colour 5.10 Bookmarks 5.11 Tooltips", " Chapter 5 Visualisations The basic elements of the report are visualisations, standalone images, and text boxes. A report can have one or more report pages and all the pages together are collectively known as the report. 5.1 Things to avoid Any component or visualization that is not directly contributing to the message should be removed and includes: Navigation - Dashboards work best when they can be understood in a glance. Do you need to include navigation options on your dashboard to drill down, drill through or filter the information on there? For easier navigation make sure to include search options in filters where possible Non-essential text - Avoid unnecessary labeling and instructions. Avoid using acronyms and technical jargon that will be confusing for the user Too much colour  Use the standard government colour guidelines (see links section) 3-Dimensional objects - Avoid at all cost because the additional angles create another cognitive barrier, which can lead to misinterpretation of data. Horizontal or vertical grid lines - In some instances grid lines are useful, but overusing them detracts from the data Too much detail  Causes distraction (e.g. £1.25m, instead of £1,254,345.67) Too many visuals can be a bad thing and make the insight were trying to provide confusing rather than useful 5.2 Simple, concise and easy to understand Modellers should not use visuals that require explanations for the user. Visuals should adhere to the following guidelines: Position elements that require the reader to make a choice to the left of the visualizations the choice will impact (e.g. slicers) Position related elements close to each other as this implies the elements are related Make important elements larger than the others or add a visual element like an arrow to draw attention Add a border, colour background or white space around related elements. Conversely, add a divider to distinguish between different sections of a report Fill the report page. If you find that you have a lot of extra white space, consider make your visualizations larger or make the canvas smaller, although remember that white space can be useful for preventing your dashboard from looking cluttered/complicated. Align the elements on the report page, either symmetrically or intentionally asymmetrically  pixel alignment in the format pane is useful for doing this 5.3 Titles and labelling The titles, labels, headings and footnotes should follow these conventions: Order columns by a field  e.g. highest value, academic year Shade columns/rows in tables for emphasis. Tables should have meaningful headings. Headings and totals should be in a bold font. Borders (if needed) should be black or in the ESFA Data Science theme (navy blue) 5.4 Numbers To help the reader make comparisons: When comparing numbers, try to ensure they are physically close together Series of numbers are easier to compare in columns Place numeric columns at the right-hand side, text to the left. Align numbers to the right (unless this looks confusing) Use the same level of precision Decimals less than one should always begin with a zero (e.g. 0.5, not .5) Format numbers with commas between thousands (e.g. 1,000) Format numbers with units Format percentages to one decimal place and in italics (e.g. 0.5%) Format large numbers for easy reading (e.g. £234,000  no need for pennies) 5.5 Rounding Making a decision on rounding can be difficult when the values show a variety of magnitudes. If so, consider rounding to a fixed number of significant figures. The extent of rounding will depend on the intended use: a commentator may be content to report that the population of the UK is 64m, or that this has changed from 63.7m to 64.1m. An analyst performing further calculations will want to work with figures that are more precise. Use dynamic rounding (via DAX) to avoid reducing precision of totals and sub-totals. 5.6 Ordering categories Ordering the categories in a table is a very effective way of aiding rapid interpretation. 5.7 Filters Filters should be located in a set area of the report page, consistently across all pages. These should be drop down filters as they save vital space and will look consistent. 5.8 Interactions At the time of writing, the default interactions for any page report is one of two variations, all depending on the type of visualisation involved. Some of the visuals default to a filter functionality whereas other visuals use the highlight method. Use the cross-filter and cross-highlight option to interact with other visualizations on the page or to sync with visualisations on other pages, where appropriate. 5.9 Colour Colour can fundamentally change how we understand the information in graphs and tables. Use colour sparingly and with restraint: Never use colour to specify something on its own Colours are most effective when they are not overused - only use different colours when they represent helpful differences of meaning in the data Be consistent in your use of colour: Use the same colour to mean the same thing in a series of graphs Use colour logically in sequences: For sequences of colours, ensure that these progress in a way that the user would expect (e.g. in luminance order) Consider accessibility: Colour blindness affects the ability to distinguish between some groups of colours (especially reds and greens). Using DfE accepted colours will enhance their experience Foreground colour: Confine use of colour to foreground items in graphs to draw attention to specific features Avoid using white as a foreground colour in graphs. It should also be avoided on maps unless it represents no data Background colour: Effective use of colour applies as much to annotation and background as it does to data elements like bars and lines In general, background colour should be avoided in tables unless it is to provide subtle highlighting Use a white background: Most colour palettes are designed to appear on a white background as it provides a helpful reference anchor for the visual system The only functional reason to use a non-white background is for viewing the image in the dark Use grey palettes for drawing and labelling axes and annotation Do not use images as backdrops in graphs or tables, as they distract the reader Colours on line graphs: Graphs with more than four lines are hard to follow, even with variations in line texture and shading. A better approach to visualise five or more lines is to use multiple single plots 5.10 Bookmarks Bookmarks help you capture the currently configured view of a report page, including filtering and the state of visuals, and later let you go back to that state by simply selecting the saved bookmark. The following elements are saved with the bookmark: Current page Filters Slicers, including slicer type (for example, dropdown or list) and slicer state Visual selection state (such as cross-highlight filters) Sort order Drill location Visibility (of an object, using the Selection pane) The focus or Spotlight modes of any visible object You can also create a collection of bookmarks, arrange them in the order you want, and subsequently step through each bookmark in a presentation to highlight a series of insights, or the story you want to tell with your visuals and reports. Bookmarks can be used to create pop-up windows, clearing filters, tabbed navigation, expand/collapse menus, page navigation and so much more. 5.11 Tooltips Tooltips are an elegant way of providing more contextual information and detail to data points on a visual. When a visualization is created, the default tooltip displays the data points value and category. Custom tooltips enable you to specify additional data points that display as part of the tooltip, simply by dragging a field into the tooltips bucket. You can also create report pages to serve as your tooltip and so include visuals, images, and any other collection of items in those pages. Each tooltip page can be associated with one or more fields in your report. Thus, when you hover over a visual that includes the selected field, the tooltip you created on your tooltip page appears when you hover over the visual, filtered by the data point over which your mouse is hovering. There are limitations to report tooltips. These are not noted here, as Power BI is continually evolving its capabilities. "],["custom-visuals.html", "Chapter 6 Custom visuals 6.1 Types of custom visuals", " Chapter 6 Custom visuals When creating or editing a Power BI report, there are many different types of visuals available for you to use. However, you are not limited to this set of visuals; selecting the ellipses opens up another source of report visuals. Custom visuals are created by developers, using the custom visuals software development kit, to enable business users to see their data in a way that fits the business best. Note: DfE is wary of using third party visuals. In general, try to stick to Microsoft approved custom visuals. 6.1 Types of custom visuals Custom visuals can be in the form of three deployment channels: Custom visuals: Packages that include code for rendering into a single .pbiviz file, that can be imported into a Power BI report Organization visuals: Power BI admins can deploy custom visuals into their organization for report authors to use. It is an easy way to discover visuals that are unique to the organization, as well as a seamless support for updating those visuals Marketplace visuals Members of the community, as well as Microsoft, have contributed their custom visuals to the benefit of the public and published them to AppSource marketplace (see the links section) "],["links.html", "Chapter 7 Links 7.1 What is Power BI desktop? 7.2 Government colour standards 7.3 Custom visuals and the AppSource marketplace 7.4 Useful links", " Chapter 7 Links 7.1 What is Power BI desktop?
