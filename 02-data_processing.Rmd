# Data processing

With **Power BI Desktop** you can connect to many different types of data in many formats. We cannot ensure that the data being collected is accurate and error-free, although the modeller should have an understanding of the data quality as described in section 2.3 above, and may need to communicate the implications of the data quality on the information in the dashboard to the customer. Data caveats including any filtering or replacement should go on the cover sheet. 

We need to understand the mentality of our viewers/audience, such as:  

* How they want to organize the report and how they want to see the report? 

* What are the main/major areas that people are interested to see in report?
